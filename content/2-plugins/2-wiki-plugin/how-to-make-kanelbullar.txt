Kanelbullar are a Swedish bakery also known as cinnamon buns.

1. Start with a regular yeast dough from 400g flour, 60g sugar, 60g butter, 250ml milk and a package of dry yeast. Let it rise for an hour, then role out thin on a flat surface.  
2. Make a filling from 60g sugar, 60g butter and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Spread on dough, role and cut into 18 equal pieces. Let them rise for 30 minutes on a backing sheet. Add egg wash and sprinkle with pearl sugar. Bake in oven at 225ÂºC for 10 minutes.
3. Enjoy.
